# This is the answer of Module 1

## The Question is :

- what are the needs to become DEVOPS such as tools to be learn, and what are the function about this devops tools?.

## The Answer is :

Becoming a DevOps Engineer In the dynamic landscape of software development and IT operations, DevOps has emerged as a crucial methodology to streamline workflows, improve collaboration, and accelerate the delivery of high-quality software. To embark on a journey towards becoming a proficient DevOps Engineer, one must familiarize themselves with a myriad of tools and their functions. In this guide, we will explore some of the essential tools and their respective functions in the DevOps ecosystem.

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Continuous integration (CI) is integrating code into a code repository and then running tests automatically, quickly, and frequently. You can do this CI by using the commit command.

Meanwhile, continuous delivery or continuous deployment (CD) is a practice carried out after the CI process is complete and all the code is successfully integrated, so that the application can be built and then released automatically.

This CI/CD pipeline is very commonly used in software development. This CI/CD pipeline is a link between the development team and the operational team, in which there are three phases, namely continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. These three phases will be carried out continuously and automatically to obtain software that is reliable and free from bugs.

## Tols CI / CD

### 1. Jenkins

Function: Jenkins is an open-source automation server that facilitates the continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) process. It allows developers to automate the build, test, and deployment phases of software development pipelines.

### 2. GitLab CI/CD

Function: GitLab CI/CD is an integrated CI/CD tool provided by GitLab. It enables developers to define, implement, and automate pipelines directly within the GitLab repository. It supports various stages such as build, test, deploy, and monitor, fostering a seamless software delivery process.

### 3. CircleCI

Function: CircleCI is a cloud-based CI/CD platform that automates the software development process. It allows teams to define workflows using configuration files, enabling the automated execution of tests, builds, and deployments across different environments.

Configuration Management

### 4. Ansible

Function: Ansible is a powerful automation tool that simplifies configuration management, application deployment, and orchestration. It utilizes YAML-based playbooks to define configurations, making it easy to manage infrastructure as code across diverse environments.

### 5. Puppet

Function: Puppet is a configuration management tool designed to automate the provisioning and management of IT infrastructure. It employs a declarative language to describe system configurations, ensuring consistency and scalability across large-scale environments.

### 6. Chef

Function: Chef is an automation platform that enables infrastructure as code practices. It allows users to define configurations using Ruby-based scripts called cookbooks, facilitating the automated deployment and management of infrastructure components.

Containerization and Orchestration 7. Docker
Function: Docker is a leading containerization platform that simplifies the packaging and deployment of applications. It allows developers to encapsulate applications and their dependencies into lightweight containers, ensuring consistency and portability across different environments.

### 8. Kubernetes

Function: Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides features such as service discovery, load balancing, and self-healing, empowering teams to efficiently manage containerized workloads at scale.

### 9. Amazon ECS/EKS, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Function: These are managed Kubernetes services provided by major cloud providers (AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure). They offer fully managed Kubernetes clusters, simplifying the deployment and management of containerized applications in the cloud environment.

Monitoring and Logging 10. Prometheus
Function: Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for cloud-native environments. It collects metrics from monitored targets, stores them in a time-series database, and enables querying and visualization of metrics for performance monitoring and troubleshooting.

### 11. ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

Function: The ELK Stack is a powerful combination of open-source tools for centralized logging and log analysis. Elasticsearch is used for storing and indexing logs, Logstash facilitates log ingestion and parsing, and Kibana provides a user-friendly interface for log visualization and analysis.

### 12. Grafana

Function: Grafana is an open-source analytics and visualization platform that enables users to query, visualize, and alert on metrics collected from various data sources. It supports integrations with monitoring systems like Prometheus, enabling the creation of custom dashboards for performance monitoring and analysis.

## Operating System Concepts

Understanding operating system concepts is fundamental for DevOps Engineers as they interact closely with various operating systems in their daily tasks. Some essential concepts include:

- Process Management: Knowledge of process scheduling, multitasking, and inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms.
- Memory Management: Understanding virtual memory, memory allocation, and memory protection mechanisms.
- File System: Familiarity with file systems, file permissions, and file system operations.
- Networking: Understanding network configuration, protocols, and socket programming for network communication.

## Virtualization vs. Containerization

### Virtualization

Definition: Virtualization involves creating virtual instances of hardware resources, such as servers, storage, or networks, to run multiple operating systems and applications simultaneously on a single physical machine.

### Containerization

Definition: Containerization involves encapsulating applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers, allowing them to run consistently across different environments.Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provisioning virtualized computing resources such as virtual machines, storage, and networking infrastructure on-demand.

## Basic Knowledge in Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is integral to modern DevOps practices, enabling scalable infrastructure, flexible deployment models, and efficient resource utilization. Key concepts in cloud computing include:

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provisioning virtualized computing resources such as virtual machines, storage, and networking infrastructure on-demand.
- Platform as a Service (PaaS): Providing platforms and tools for application development, deployment, and management without worrying about underlying infrastructure.
- Software as a Service (SaaS): Delivering software applications over the internet on a subscription basis, eliminating the need for local installation and maintenance.
- Cloud Service Models: Understanding the differences between public, private, and hybrid cloud deployments and their respective use cases.
- Cloud Providers: Familiarity with major cloud providers such as AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, including their services, pricing models, and management consoles.
