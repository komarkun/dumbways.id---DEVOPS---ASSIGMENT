Network Topology and Basic Network

    Network Topology: This refers to the layout of connections between devices in a network. It defines how data flows from one device to another. There are two main categories:
        Physical Topology: The physical arrangement of cables and devices. Common types include bus, star, ring, mesh, and tree.
        Logical Topology: The way data actually flows through the network, regardless of physical connections.

    Basic Network Components:
        Nodes: Devices on the network, such as computers, printers, servers, and routers.
        Connections: Links that allow nodes to communicate, typically cables or wireless signals.
        Network Devices: Hardware that facilitates communication, like switches, routers, and firewalls.

Application Configuration and Service Management

    Application Configuration: The process of defining settings and parameters for a software application to function properly. This may involve:
        Setting up database connections.
        Specifying security credentials.
        Defining environment variables.
        Configuring logging and monitoring.

    Service Management: The lifecycle management of applications and services. This includes:
        Provisioning: Setting up and deploying services.
        Configuration Management: Maintaining consistent configurations across environments.
        Monitoring: Tracking service health and performance.
        Scaling: Adjusting resource allocation based on demand.
        Orchestration: Automating the deployment and management of complex applications.

Documentation in Network and Application Management

    Importance: Clear and concise documentation is crucial for:
        Troubleshooting: Identifying and resolving issues more efficiently.
        Scalability: Supporting future growth and modifications.
        Knowledge Transfer: Enabling new team members to understand the system.

    What to Document:
        Network topology diagrams.
        Hardware and software inventory.
        Application configuration details.
        Service management procedures.
        Troubleshooting guides.
